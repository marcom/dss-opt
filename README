Dynamics in Sequence Space Optimisation (DSS-Opt)

RNA sequence design for a given target secondary structure.  Sequences
are designed by optimising a design score in a continuous sequence
space, allowing a mixture of bases at each position during
optimisation.

The code can be compiled by running `make', the dynamics in sequence
space optimisation is performed with the program opt-md.

There is a little program that uses the Vienna RNA library to compute
the ensemble defect of a designed sequence to a given target
structure.  You can find it under the directory
rna-ensemble-distance-with-ViennaRNA/.  Edit the Makefile in this
subdirectory to point to the directory where you installed the Vienna
RNA package, then run `make'.

Sorry for the lack of git history, i had multiple git repos symlinked
together and tried to merge the histories, in the end it was simply
easier to start a new combined git repo.

The parameters for the RNA nearest neighbour energy model were
converted from Vienna RNA, many thanks to them.  The script used to
convert them is under scripts/.
